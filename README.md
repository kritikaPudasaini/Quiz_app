Question Answer Application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
#Issues:
1.Flutter doesn't support hover functionality on mobile applications, which limits the interactivity options for certain features.
2.On the quiz screen, using return Scaffold in Dart led to the creation of a default container, causing the background image to not display as intended.
3.As a beginner in Flutter, I faced challenges with understanding and implementing proper padding, which affected the layout and design consistency.
